# Reproducing Music Scores Using Gabor Transform
Using the Gabor Transform, we analyzed audio clips of two famous songs and were able to derive
the frequencies of the notes being played by particular instruments. Then, since we know the exact
frequencies of the notes, we were able to recreate the music score for that instrument. Also, in this
project, we were able to isolate certain instruments from the audio clips, allowing us to play filtered clips
that contain only that instrument.
