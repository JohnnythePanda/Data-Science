# Time Frequency Analysis
We performed time-frequency analysis on noisy acoustic data from the Puget Sound to detect a
moving submarine emitting an unknown frequency with algorithms emphasizing the Fourier Transform.
We analyzed the data by averaging the spectrum of raw acoustic data which allows us to identify it’s
distinctive frequency signature in which a filter created based on this signature. Then we apply the filter
to the data to effectively isolate this frequency in order to approximately find the submarine’s trajectory
in real space and time.
